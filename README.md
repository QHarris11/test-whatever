### Native Mobile

Kotlin and Swift are both strongly typed languages.

#### iOS 
- Swift (.swift)
- SwiftUI

#### Android
- Kotlin (.kt)
- Jetpack Compose

Main takeaways:
- Single language for all of your codebase (frontend and backend)
- Strongly typed languages make it easy to write safe code


### Web

Codebases have 3 worlds:
1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. Business logic

#### Frontend
Code that builds the user interface.

- React (reusable components)
- HTML (just layout - like markdown)
- CSS (styling - colors, font sizes, fonts, etc)

#### Backend
- TypeScript
 
Model definitions, eg car:

```
class car: {
    color: string
    passenegerCap: int
}
```

#### Business Logic
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Rust
- Go
  
Functions that do stuff with your models and often notify the frontend

```
function logColor(car) {
    console.log(car.color)
}
```
